# URL Shortener

🚀 Overview

A high-performance, scalable URL Shortener built with Golang, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker. This project is optimized for concurrent requests and ensures race condition safety, making it ideal for handling high traffic efficiently.

🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Golang (Gin framework)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (Optimized indexing for fast lookups)
*   **Caching:** Redis (For low-latency access)
*   **Containerization:** Docker + Docker Compose
*   **Testing:** Unit tests + Load testing for concurrency
*   **Concurrency Handling:** Atomic operations & Goroutines

🔥 Key Features

*   **Fast Redirection:** Uses Redis caching to reduce database hits.
*   **Concurrency-Safe Hit Counting:** Atomic counters prevent race conditions.
*   **Dockerized Setup:** Easily deploy with Docker Compose.
*   **Scalability:** Supports thousands of concurrent requests.

🏆 Performance Enhancements

*   **Redis Caching:** Avoids redundant database queries, improving speed.
*   **Atomic Operations:** Ensures accurate hit counting without data races.
*   **Goroutines & WaitGroups:** Handles multiple requests efficiently.
*   **Batch Updates to DB:** Periodically updates PostgreSQL to reduce write contention.

🏎 Race Condition Handling

*   **Problem:** Concurrent requests could cause inconsistent hit counts.
*   **Solution:** Used atomic counters and a batch flush system to safely update the database.
*   **Verification:** Wrote unit tests with concurrent requests to ensure correctness.

⏳ Time & Cost Savings

**⏳ Time Savings**

Benchmark Results:

*   10,000 requests, 100 concurrency: 8017 req/sec, avg 12.47ms per request.
*   100,000 requests, 500 concurrency: 7171 req/sec, avg 69.71ms per request.

With Redis Caching:

*   Response time reduced from ~50ms to ~5ms.
*   **🔹 90% reduction in response time!**

💰 Cost Savings

Database Load Reduction (80% fewer queries):

*   Without caching: 1M requests → 1M queries = $10
*   With caching: 1M requests → 200K queries = $2
*   **🔹 Saves $8 per million requests.**

Infrastructure Cost Reduction:

*   Scaling PostgreSQL for 1M queries requires a high-performance DB instance (~$50/month).
*   With caching, PostgreSQL handles 5x more traffic without upgrades.
*   **🔹 Saves ~$50/month on cloud database scaling.**

🛠 Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
